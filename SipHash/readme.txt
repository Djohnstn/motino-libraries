This version of the SipHash library works for all boards that compile with Arduino IDE
uses only byte manipulations so works for 8bit, 16bit, 32bit and 64bit cpu's
Does not use any AVR assembler.
The only special C construct used is memcpy_p and PROGMEM to get data from flash storage

Version 2 of library compiled for UNO
Sketch uses 4,888 bytes (15%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32,256 bytes.
Global variables use 226 bytes (11%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1,822 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2,048 bytes.
